        <p>Hi! <3 My name is Jacqueline B. Nguyen, and I am a freshman at La Quinta<br> 
        High School. I'm currently taking the AP Computer Science Principles<br>
        class with Ms. Terry Nguyen, after taking the Exploring Computer Science<br> 
        class over the summer. Some clubs I'm participating in are Key Club,<br>
        Future Medical Leaders, PAWS, National Honor Society, and CSF. If<br>
        possible, it'd be appreciative if I could get accepted into universities<br>
        such as Harvad, Berkley, MIT, or anything at least :). In my journey through<br>
        high school, I wish to accomplish several things. To start off, I want to be<br>
        more social in high school, interact with teachers and students, and join as<br>
        many distinct clubs as possible. I want to join enough clubs and activities<br>
        to please colleges and universities, but not overexert myself. Also, I would<br>
        love to fulfill my A-G requirements and go above and beyond what others expect<br> 
        of me. I hope to graduate high school with a GPA higher than 4.0, if possible,<br> 
        with many friends and classmates beside me.<br> 
        </p>
