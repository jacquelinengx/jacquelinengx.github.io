            <h3>Description of Game</h3>
            <p>The concept behind this game is just a simple maze, but with a <br>
               Monsters Inc. theme so it is more enjoyable and interesting for <br>
               users. Basically, the main goal of the game is to get the character, <br>
               Mike Wazowski to collect as many coins as possible and exit the maze.<br>
               The amount of coins collected is basically the scoring system, <br>
               where the more coins collected, the higher the score. Randomness <br>
               occurs when the x-position of each of the coins are placed and set<br>
               within a given range. There were originally supposed to be three levels,<br>
               that increased in difficulty, but I only managed enough time to <br>
               create two levels. The first level is just a maze, but the second <br>
               level gets harder when the orange moving doors are added as obstacles. <br>
               It is more difficult because if you touched any of the orange blocks, <br>
               you would lose the game. However, if you can reach the exit<br>
               with no difficulties, then you would have finished and the game <br>
               would be over. </p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This Monsters Inc. Maze game first started out as a normal maze.<br>
            Unexpectedly while I was working on my project, I was deciding on<br>
            characters that you could choose from. Out of nowhere, I had the idea<br>
            of using characters from Monsters Inc., which created the basis for my <br>
            game. Two successful points in the development process of my game is <br>
            when the character sprite was successfully changed from the choose button<br>
            into the actual character and when the end of the maze was correctly coded<br>
            to display the "Well Done!" sign. Both these aspects were successful in <br>
            making my game work. On the other hand, there were also some difficult <br>
            factors that caused some trouble for me. For instance, the green arrows <br>
            to navigate between the pages was quite confusing and so were coding <br>
            the coins. I was able to get through this difficult coding experience by<br>
            slowly reviewing my coding and finding the mistakes that I've made. If<br>
            I had more time, I would have changed my game so that there would be more<br>
            than two levels. Not only that, but if possible, it would have been nice<br>
            if you chould choose Boo or Sullivan as a character and Mike wasn't the<br>
            only option, but I didn't have enough time.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Algorithms</h3>
            <p><img src="algorithm.PNG" height="100%" width="100%" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
            An algorithm is a set of step-by-step procedures that contains loops, <br>
            conditionals, or mathematical operations. The algorithm above displays<br>
            the differents tasks for the sprite to carry out once the flag is clicked.<br> 
            It also contains a forever loop and a repeat loop. This algoritm works since<br>
            after the flag is clicked, it goes to the correct position and shows itself.<br>
            From there, it would continously repeat going to the right a little, waiting<br>
            a short bit, going to the left a bit, and waiting again, forever. This overall<br>
            gives the sprite a back and forth stuttering motion. </p>
