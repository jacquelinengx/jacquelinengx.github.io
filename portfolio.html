            <h3>Description of Game</h3>
            <p>The concept behind this game is just a simple maze, but with a <br>
               Monsters Inc. theme so it is more enjoyable and interesting for <br>
               users. Basically, the main goal of the game is to get the character, <br>
               Mike Wazowski to collect as many coins as possible and exit the maze.<br>
               The amount of coins collected is basically the scoring system, <br>
               where the more coins collected, the higher the score. Randomness <br>
               occurs when the x-position of each of the coins are placed and set<br>
               within a given range. There were originally supposed to be three levels,<br>
               that increased in difficulty, but I only managed enough time to <br>
               create two levels. The first level is just a maze, but the second <br>
               level gets harder when the orange moving doors are added as obstacles. <br>
               It is more difficult because if you touched any of the orange blocks, <br>
               you would lose the game. However, if you can reach the exit<br>
               with no difficulties, then you would have finished and the game <br>
               would be over. 
            </p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This Monsters Inc. Maze game first started out as a normal maze.<br>
               Unexpectedly while I was working on my project, I was deciding on<br>
               characters that you could choose from. Out of nowhere, I had the idea<br>
               of using characters from Monsters Inc., which created the basis for my <br>
               game. Two successful points in the development process of my game is <br>
               when the character sprite was successfully changed from the choose button<br>
               into the actual character and when the end of the maze was correctly coded<br>
               to display the "Well Done!" sign. Both these aspects were successful in <br>
               making my game work. On the other hand, there were also some difficult <br>
               factors that caused some trouble for me. For instance, the green arrows <br>
               to navigate between the pages was quite confusing and so were coding <br>
               the coins. I was able to get through this difficult coding experience by<br>
               slowly reviewing my coding and finding the mistakes that I've made. If<br>
               I had more time, I would have changed my game so that there would be more<br>
               than two levels. Not only that, but if possible, it would have been nice<br>
               if you chould choose Boo or Sullivan as a character and Mike wasn't the<br>
               only option, but I didn't have enough time.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Algorithms</h3>
            <img src="algorithm.PNG">
            <p>
               An algorithm is a set of step-by-step procedures that contains loops, <br>
               conditionals, or mathematical operations. The algorithm above displays<br>
               the differents tasks for the sprite to carry out once the flag is clicked.<br> 
               It also contains a forever loop and a repeat loop. This algoritm works since<br>
               after the flag is clicked, it goes to the correct position and shows itself.<br>
               From there, it would continously repeat going to the right a little, waiting<br>
               a short bit, going to the left a bit, and waiting again, forever. This overall<br>
               gives the sprite a back and forth stuttering motion. <br>

            <h3>Summary of Depresso Cat</h3>
            <p>
                In this story, the user is put into the perspective of a little cat <br>
                on Christmas Eve, lonely and depressed. As a cat, you are given decisions <br>
                to make, ultimately leading to staying isolated, or finding happiness. Tragic <br>
                endings such as loneliness or even death can occur depending on what the user <br>
                chooses. But there are also happier endings, like finding a family and even <br>
                recovering your past memories. How the cat ends up is up to the user! <br>

            <h3>Development Process</h3>
            <p>
               My story was programmed on Python independently, by myself. Making a <br>
               flowchart was an incremental process because I broke the process into <br>
               separate pieces and started with the introduction, christmas_eve(). <br>
               After, I typed out the next part to create separate scenes, like <br>
               wheel_encounter(). I created more events until I was satisfied. Each <br>
               scene was made into it's own function that was linked together to make <br>
               a flowing story. I also incorporated iterative processes into my <br>
               programming when I went through a cycle of writing the code, testing <br>
               it, and revising it, repeating this to solve any errors and improve my <br>
               coding. I made my story more engaging by having a time limit. I searched <br>
               up how to put a time limit on user inputs and added it into my program. <br>
               However, I did have some trouble because after the timer was added, the <br>
               program would stop working. I had to adapt to the situation by asking for <br>
               another user input, like 'Click space to continue.' Another problem was <br>
               when my coding skipped some functions. This was resolved when I checked <br>
               it and realized one function was spelled wrong. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Advantages of Abstraction</h3>
            <p>
               Organizing the scenes of my story is a form of procedural abstraction <br>
               since each of the scenes represented it's own function. For instance, <br>
               the function, home_sweet_home() is a method of procedural abstraction <br>
               because this scene with a bunch of different lines was created under one <br>
               name. It needed to be called more than one time, but with abstraction, <br>
               the advantage was that I didn't have to rewrite the entire code and I <br>
               could just call the one function name instead. This is also procedural <br>
               abstraction because I know that I want this function to be called after <br>
               meet_liams_fam() or after yEs_home_with_adelynn(), depending on which <br>
               path the user chooses, but how one function calls another function is <br>
               not entirely known. When I call a function, the program links scenes <br>
               together, but I don't know exactly how the program does it, meaning this <br>
               is procedural abstraction. Another form of procedural abstraction in my <br>
               story is the use of the typing() function. From a user's viewpoint, the <br>
               name typing() gives them a hint of what the function does, but not how <br>
               it does it. Similarly to the scene functions, there is an advantage to <br>
               procedural abstraction since it shortens the code by simplifying the <br>
               function. Instead of typing the code for typing() every time something <br>
               needs to be typed, I could just call the typing() function so the code <br>
               is simpler and easier for users to understand. In the end, there were <br>
               several uses of procedural abstraction within my code and story's program, <br>
               which adds many advantages, from being easy to code to being easy to read. <br>

            <h3>Other Stories</h3>
            <p>
                Some other stories that my classmates made were quite interesting, <br>
                such as BANK HEI$T and DEV.AI. I found BANK HEI$T quite intruging <br>
                since it was suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat. Not <br>
                only that, but this story was fun because there were many different <br>
                endings and choices to make. DEV.AI was another story I found fascinating <br>
                because this story also was very well organized and gave you many <br>
                different paths and choices to choose from. If I had the chance to read <br>
                more stories, I'm sure my classmates' programs would've been great! <br>
